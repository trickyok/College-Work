Living organisms...
	Made of cells consisting of organic compounds
	Need an energy source (sun, chemical, foods, etc)
	Has metabolism to use energy
	Respond to stimuli in their environment
	Have genetic material (DNA > RNA > proteins)

dogma balls

Cells - Two Types!
	Prokaryote (before kernel)
		Cells without defined nucleus
		Genetic material not contained within membrane
	Eukaryote (with kernel)
		Cells have defined nucleus wherever genetic material is kept

both are fucking gross looking

Three Domain System
	Bacteria (prokaryotes - normal)
	Archaea (prokaryotes of extremes)
	Eukarya (eukaryotes with nuclei)

What is an animal?
	They eat other organisms
	They move
	They are multicellular

The Animals
	Deuterostomes (butthole first)
		Chordates - Monke
		Echinoderms - Starfish
	Protosomes (Mouth first)
		Grow by molting
			Arthropods - Bee
			Roundworms - Worm
		Mollusks - Squid
		Annelids - Worm
		Flatworms - Slug?
	Radically Symmetrical
		Cnidarians - Jellyfish
	No tissues or organs
		Sponges - idk
Pick a thing on the chart, everything to its left shares something in common that
everything to the right doesn't have. For example, sponges don't have tissues or organs
but everything to its left does.


Cells are important - They allow a creature to do more things as it contains 
		      differently functioning cells for each purpose

Symmetry - Is the thing shaped like a pie (radial symmetry) or mirrored 
	   between the left and right sides (bilateral symmetry)

Gut development - Does the gut develop from front to back (protostomes - mouth first)
		  or develop back to front (deuterostomes - butthole first)

this shi looks nasty

Triploblastic Body Types
	Acoelomate - Mesoderm with no cavity
	Pseudocoelomate - Mesoderm covers ectoderm but no endoderm
	Coelomate - Mesoderm covers ecto and endoderm with cavity between

Sponges
	Hermaphrodytes!!!!!
	Can't really move, but the eggs can once they become larvae
Phylim Cnidaria
	Two tissue layers
	True radial symmetry, based and circlepilled
Phylum Platyhelminthes
	Bilateral symmetry
	Three cell layers
	No true body cavity
Tapeworm
	cats poop the eggs out
Phylum Nematoda
	Three cell layers with a cavity
	nematoads
Phylum Annelida
	earthworms, marine worms, leeches
	Three cell layers
	Mouth forms first
	true body cavity
	elongated body with repeating segments
Phylum Mollusca
	Snails, slugs, clams, cephalopods
	Bilaterally symmetrical
	gastropods - belly foot
Phylum Arthropoda
	Arachnids, crustaceans, myriapods, insects
	Triploblastic
	Coelomate
	Protostomates
	Chitinous Exoskeleton - shed
	Ventral nerve cord
	Open circulatory system
	Largest animal phylum!
Phylum Echinodermata
	Starfish, Sea Urchins, Sea Cucumbers
	Butthole first
	Not true radial symmetry
Phylum Chordata
	Tunicates, Lanceletes, Vertebrates
	Hollow nerve cord
	Notochord
	Post-anal tail!
		except humans lol
