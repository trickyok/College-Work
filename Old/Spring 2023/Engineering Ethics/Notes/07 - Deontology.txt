The Trolley Problem
	- Case 1
		- Train is going to hit 5 people, unless you change its path it hits 1 person
		- 5% say 5 deaths
		- 95% say 1 death
	- Case 2
		- Train is going to hit 5 people, unless you push a fat dude in front to stop it
		- 80% say 5 deaths
		- 20% say 1 death
	- Is an argument against consequentialism because it SHOULD be the same response due to outcomes being the same
