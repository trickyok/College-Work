			- sensory pleasures
			- eating
			- sex
			- rolling in mud
		- higher pleasures (only human capable) - higher quality
			- intellect
			- moral sentiments
			- imagination
			- emotion
			- sensation
	- Said to be better as an unsatisfied human than a satisfied pig
		- Fool vs Socrates
			- life of pleasure and stupidity, or a life of torture and all of the higher pleasures
		Objection: How do we know which pleasures are more desirable?
		Response:  People who have experienced both, decide.
