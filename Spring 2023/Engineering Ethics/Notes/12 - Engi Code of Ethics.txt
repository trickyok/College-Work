1. Surprising
	- Perform services only in areas of their competence

2. Important
	- Engineers shall not be influenced in their professional duties by conflicting interests (taking bribes)

3. Unimportant
	- Engineers shall give credit for engineering work to those to whom credit is due,
	  and will recognize the proprietary interests of others

4. Disagree
	- Engineers shall at all times strive to serve the public interest
		- What if public interest is objectively wrong?

5. Contradictory
	- Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public	
		- What if the public interest will result in unsafety for the public?

6. Confusing
	-
