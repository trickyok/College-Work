- nested loops
- test exhaustively
- (w^a)(x^b)(y^c)(z^d)



- loop one
	- loop through possible exponents of w
	
	- loop two
		- loop through possible exponents of x
		
		- loop three
			- loop through possible exponents of y
			
			- loop four
				- loop through possible exponents of z
				- compare value to mu
				- if value closer to mu than others, save it
	
- calculate error between found value and mu
- print all data found
